# dflow-autotest
## General properties test with VASP, ABACUS, and LAMMPS in autotest.
This workflow is a part of [AI Square](https://aissquare.com/). We want to refract the autotest code based on dflow. 
This is "general properties test" (elastic parameters, EOS, surface energy, interstitial energy, vacancy energy and stacking fault energy supported so far) using VASP, LAMMPS, or ABACUS.

## Easy Install：
```
pip install "git+https://github.com/ZLI-afk/dflow-autotest.git"
```

## Quick Start
You can go to the `example` folder and there are some examples for reference. You can go to one of them and fill in the `global.json` file. Then you can submit the workflow.

If you want to use VASP code to do the DFT autotest, like the folder `vasp_demo`. You need to prepare `INCAR`, `POTCAR`, `POSCAR`, `global.json`(notice that json files for relaxation and properties task are needed as input arguments), then ：
``` 
dflowautotest param_relax.json param.props.json --vasp
```
If you want to run only relaxation or only properties test (notice that properties test requires relaxation results under corresponding path in ./confs), for example for relaxation, just give one argument like:
``` 
dflowautotest param_relax.json --vasp
```

If you want to use ABACUS code, like the folder `abacus_demo`. You need to prepare `INPUT`, `STRU`, `*.UPF`, `global.json`, `param_relax.json`, `param_props.json` (notice that `*.orb` and `KPT` are optional ), then：
```
dflowautotest param_relax.json param_props.json --abacus
```

If you want to use LAMMPS to do MD calculation, like the folder `lammps_demo`. You need to prepare `POSCAR`, `frozen_model.pb`, `global.json`, `param_relax.json`, `param_props.json`, then:
```
dflowautotest param_relax.json param_props.json --lammps
```
